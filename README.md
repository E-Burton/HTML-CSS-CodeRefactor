# HTML & CSS: Code Refactor

## Objective

To improve website code to meet semantic element standards for accessibility and SEO purposes.

## Adjustments

Title was changed to Horiseon Marketing to provide a better site description. All links were checked and are now working properly. CSS file was condensed, organized to follow logical structure, and commented for easier understadning/review. Image elements have been given alt and title attributes, providing image descriptions upon hovering over and in the case that the user is unable to view the image.
